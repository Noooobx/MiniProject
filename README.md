A Web App for Connecting Farmers and Consumers

A web application designed to empower farmers by enabling them to directly sell their crops to consumers. This platform eliminates the middlemen, ensuring fair prices and fresh, locally sourced produce for consumers. With a user-friendly interface, farmers can list their products, while consumers can browse and purchase fresh produce directly from the source.

## Features

- **Farmer Dashboard**: Allows farmers to create accounts, list crops, update availability, and manage orders.
- **Consumer Dashboard**: Consumers can browse available crops, filter by type, and place orders directly with farmers.
- **Order Management**: Facilitates seamless order tracking for both farmers and consumers.
- **Search and Filters**: Consumers can search for specific crops and filter based on location, type, and availability.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment gateway for smooth transactions.
